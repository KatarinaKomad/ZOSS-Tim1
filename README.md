## Mobile security - iOS vs Android
Mobile devices are an integral part of our daily lives, facilitating communication, entertainment, and productivity while 
also storing sensitive personal and corporate information. With the widespread adoption of smartphones and tablets, the need for robust mobile security has never been more critical.[5](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/misy/2020/8828078/)

This project aims to examine the challenges associated with mobile security, with a specific focus on the iOS and Android platforms as well as their comparison.

Our research will be centered on the decomposition of both architectures to target modules, covering layers of hardware, software, and operating system.

The objective is to strategically analyze each module and therefore identify potential threats and known vulnerabilities, describe specific attacks that occur, present the most current solutions or preventions, but also to potentially propose future strategies to strengthen the general security of mobile devices.

This exploration will strive to maintain a balance between conciseness and comprehensive coverage.


## Content overview
* ### [Architecture](documentation/architecture.md)  
  Document provides a comparative overview of the layered architectures of Android and iOS systems.  
  It highlights key components and fundamental principles guiding their designs.  
  These components will further be used as key points of analysis in terms of targeted modules in common threats and attacks.
