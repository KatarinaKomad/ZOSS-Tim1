This analysis will contain threats, attacks, and adequate mitigation strategies or standard security protocols developers are meant to follow. It is crucial not only for delivering a seamless user experience but also for safeguarding the confidentiality, ensuring integrity, and availability of the implemented features.

It is every organization's/developer's responsibility to make sure that the code, logic, data, and its communication is secured in the right way to prevent from any intruders tampering and understanding the code. [[1]](#resources)

This security analysis consists of three parts:
1. [Media input vulnerabilities analysis](media-input-vulnerabilities.md)
2. [Media access vulnerabilities analysis](media-access-vulnerabilities.md)
2. [Microphone/Camera access vulnerabilities analysis](unauthorized-access-to-mic-cam.md)
