# Target modules
Initial decomposition to target modules of mobile device security analysis.

## 1. Device Security 
The physical nature of mobile devices makes them prone to theft or loss.  
Unauthorized access to a lost or stolen device can result in data breaches and identity theft.

### Android  
Google's main vulnerabilities come from the complete decentralization of its operations. Since they license their OS to multiple hardware makers, it inevitably ends up on cheap phones with below-par security features

### iOS
Apple has a fairly good reputation hardware-wise.
iOS is not easy to jailbreak. This means both the hardware and software is controlled by Apple.

## 2. Data Security
Data on the mobile devices can be easily lost or stolen. Therefore, data stored on the mobile devices should be encrypted to
ensure safety and security.
### Android
With each version, android tries to improve encryption strategies to ensure safety of their users.
### iOS
Data encryption in iOS is not configurable; therefore it is not disabled by the users.

## 3. Network Security  
Mobile devices often connect to public Wi-Fi networks, making them susceptible to attacks such as Man-in-the-Middle (MitM).
Unsecured Wi-Fi connections expose sensitive information to potential eavesdropping and unauthorized access.
### Android
### iOS


## 4. App Security  
The proliferation of malicious software and unwanted applications poses a significant threat to mobile security. Cybercriminals exploit vulnerabilities in mobile operating systems and app ecosystems to deliver malware, compromising user data and privacy.
### Android
Google Play is a much more permissive marketplace and has allowed several apps that were simply straight-up malware to be hosted on its servers over the years.
### iOS
While the App Store has famously stringent rules of operation, certain apps with code flaws have slipped through.  
In fact, their main vulnerability comes from apps.


## 5. Operating System Security  
OS is vital in keeping device secure. It sets up access controls to protect data and ensures that only authorized users can access it. It also handles encryption to keep user information safe when transmitted.
### Android
Android not only receives fewer updates, but certain users may also be behind several versions depending on the hardware maker of their phone.  
Samsung phones, for example, feature a heavily customized version of Android and often don't get the newest Android update until its features are ensured to be compatible with the latest version.
### iOS
Apple performs regular updates on iOS and launches a brand-new version every 2 to 3 years.  
Once it is released, every iPhone gets it at the same time, except in certain countries where Apple has deals with cellphone providers to launch it when they approve.
